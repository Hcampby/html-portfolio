    <h1>The Best Movies According to Harrison</h1>
    <h2>A list of my favourite movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Bladerunner 2049</h3>
        <p>I'm a sucker for a good vibe, rain, neon lights, and a guy trying to figure out who he really is.</p>
    <h3>Dune: Part One & Two</h3>
        <p>It's about staying calm in the chaos, and proving you can handle way more than you think (even if it's sandworms).</p>
    <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
        <p>The perfect mix of chaos, intensity, and “I could watch this ten more times.</p>
    <h3>The Batman</h3>
        <p>Brooding, methodical, and all about focus, plus, it makes detective work look way cooler than it probably is.</p>
    <h3>Porco Rosso</h3>
        <p>A flying pig, seaplanes, and a weird amount of heart, it just makes me happy.</p>
    <h3>Fast & Furious 3</h3>
        <p>Drifting, neon lights, and one of the best soundtracks ever. What more do you need?</p>
    <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
        <p>I admire its intensity, moral weight, and portrayal of how brilliance can both build and destroy.</p>
    <h3>Predator</h3>
        <p>The ultimate “survival of the fittest” movie, muscles, mayhem, and one-liners for days.</p>
