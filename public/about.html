  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Harrison Campbell, an aspiring full-stack developer with a 
  strong enthusiasm for learning and building meaningful web applications. 
  I'm currently developing my skills across both front-end and back-end 
  technologies, and I'm eager to take on real-world projects that help me 
  grow as a developer while contributing to something impactful. </p>

  <p>Outside of coding, I'm a dedicated rugby player for Newton Abbot
  and an avid spearfisher and angler. Whether in the water or on the field, 
  I value focus, discipline, and teamwork â€” qualities I strive to bring 
  into every aspect of my development journey.</p>
